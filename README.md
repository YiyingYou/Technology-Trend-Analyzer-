# Technology Trend Analyzer
Technology Trend Analyzer is an R-based web application hosted on the shinyapp.io server. It can scrape 50 job descriptions each to 30 different job titles that appeared in the O*NET Occupation database from Indeed.com and analyze the frequency of technologies in the job descriptions. It can show the bar graph of technology frequency grouped by a standard technology list from O'Reilly's compilation of technologies. This website supports the download service of frequency tables in CSV files. 

## How to use this?
* Because Indeed.com has the anti-web-crawler system, users cannot scrape all 1500 (30 job titles times 50 job descriptions) job descriptions from Indeed.com once a time. If users run the code function automatically, it will show an Error message. Therefore, the solution to this problem is running the frequency function one by one with 30 minutes apart and letting R count the frequency (run the function on Line 104 of the mainfunction(revised).csv and change the code to: for (job in jobtitles$Job_Title[1]) and so on) of these job descriptions. 
* After running the R code of mainfunction, users can use the shiny app to see the bar graph and download the frequency table in a CSV file.
